Refactorings Applied
=====================
- Moved JavaScript to an external linked file
- Added footer for link to JavaScript file
- Added doctype
- Added character encoding
- Fixed indentation so there is another indent for each level
- Moved table structure to html page, keeping data and function in js page
- Defined a function for the accounts data so it can be reused with other data
- Moved 'strong' styling on 'Total' row to an external css file
